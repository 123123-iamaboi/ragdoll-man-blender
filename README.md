# ragdoll man blender
 this is a ragdoll I created in Blender using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtaG8EqN_nw
 
 **INSTRUCTIONS:**
 1. the green objects are used to propel the red objects. The yellow objects show what the ragdoll collides with.
 2. assign a passive rigidbody on all the green objects that you want to use to propel the rigidbody.
 3. assign a passive rigidbody on all the yellow objects.
 4. assign an active rigidbody on the red ball. Rigidbody is already added to the ragdoll man.
 5. PROFIT.
